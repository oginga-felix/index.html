CodeVA (short for Code Virginia) is a non-profit organization dedicated to expanding computer science education across schools and communities in Virginia, USA. It serves as a bridge between students, educators, and families to ensure all learners gain access to quality computing knowledge.
<br>

<h3  style="color:green"><u>courses They Offer</u></h3>

CodeVA provides a broad range of resources and services focused on computer science education:

Student Programs: Hands-on workshops, summer camps, and arts-integrated coding activities that engage students from elementary to high school.

Teacher Professional Development: Training, coaching, and support to help teachers confidently teach computer science in classrooms.

Curriculum & Resources: Lesson plans, downloadable materials, and structured pathways (including introductory AI modules) that educators can use.

Support & Consultation: Strategic planning, mentorship, lesson review, and grant planning services to schools and school divisions.

Many of these services are available at no cost to public school teachers and are designed to help schools integrate computer science education effectively.

<div id="courses" tabindex="-1">
<h3 style="color:green"><u>Location</u></h3>

CodeVA is headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, USA and works statewide throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia to support computer science education in schools and communities.

<br>
<h3 style="color:green"><u>How It Started</u></h3>

CodeVA was founded in 2013 with the mission of making computer science accessible to all Virginia students. It became the first regional partner of Code.org, a major national nonprofit that promotes computer science education in schools. From its early days, CodeVA focused on student programs, teacher training, and advocacy for computer science literacy in K-12 education.

<br>
<h3 style="color:green"><u>Their Mission & Impact</u></h3>

The organization operates on the belief that everyone deserves the opportunity to learn coding and computing skills. CodeVA partners with schools, parents, and communities to build equitable access to computing resources. It helps teachers learn how to teach computer science and provides students with opportunities to explore technology through engaging, hands-on experiences.

<br>
<h3 style="color:green"><u>Recent Developments & Future Plans</u></h3>


In late 2024, CodeVA shifted largely to remote operations and reorganized to reduce costs while continuing its mission, including developing free computer science curricula for wider distribution.

The organization plans to expand its reach by partnering with out-of-school providers so that more youths can access high-quality CS resources and training, even without direct staffing.
